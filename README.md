# LNURL: Lightning Network UX protocol

`LNURL` is a bech32-encoded HTTPS/Onion query string which is supposed to help payer interact with payee and thus simplify a number of standard scenarios such as:

- Requesting incoming channels ([LNURL-channel](lnurl-channel.md))
- Logging in ([LNURL-auth](lnurl-auth.md))
- Withdrawing funds ([LNURL-withdraw](lnurl-withdraw.md))
- Paying for a service ([LNURL-pay](lnurl-pay.md))

An example `LNURL`:
> `https://service.com/api?q=3fc3645b439ce8e7f2553a69e5267081d96dcd340693afabe04be7b0ccd178df`

would be bech32-encoded as:
> `LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7UM9WFMXJCM99E3K7MF0V9CXJ0M385EKVCENXC6R2C35XVUKXEFCV5MKVV34X5EKZD3EV56NYD3HXQURZEPEXEJXXEPNXSCRVWFNV9NXZCN9XQ6XYEFHVGCXXCMYXYMNSERXFQ5FNS`

and presented as the following QR:

Once `LNURL` is decoded:
- If `tag` query parameter is present then this `LNURL` has a special meaning, further actions will be based on `tag` parameter value.
- Otherwise a GET request should be executed which must return a JSON object containing a `tag` field, further actions will be based on `tag` field value.

## Self-signed certificates for Onion addresses

`LNURL` links must use `https` at all times, self-signed certificates are only allowed for v2/v3 onion addresses.

## Fallback scheme

`LNURL` can be used as fallback inside of other URI schemes, with the key 'lightning' and the value equal to the bech32-encoding, an example: `https://service.com/giftcard/redeem?id=123&lightning=LNURL1...`

## HTTP Status Codes and Content-Type

Neither status codes or any HTTP Header has any meaning. Servers may use whatever they want. Clients should ignore them (and be careful when using libraries that treat responses differently based on headers and status codes) and just parse the response body as JSON, then interpret it accordingly.

## Decoding examples

In Scala:
```scala
import fr.acinq.bitcoin.Bech32

val bech32lnurl: String = "LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7UM9WFMXJCM99E3K7MF0V9CXJ0M385EKVCENXC6R2C35XVUKXEFCV5MKVV34X5EKZD3EV56NYD3HXQURZEPEXEJXXEPNXSCRVWFNV9NXZCN9XQ6XYEFHVGCXXCMYXYMNSERXFQ5FNS"

val (hrp, dataPart) = Bech32.decode(bech32lnurl)
val requestByteArray = Bech32.five2eight(dataPart)

new String(requestByteArray, "UTF-8") // https://service.com/api?q=3fc3645b439ce8e7f2553a69e5267081d96dcd340693afabe04be7b0ccd178df
```

In JavaScript:
```js
var { bech32 } = require("bech32")

let bech32lnurl = "LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7UM9WFMXJCM99E3K7MF0V9CXJ0M385EKVCENXC6R2C35XVUKXEFCV5MKVV34X5EKZD3EV56NYD3HXQURZEPEXEJXXEPNXSCRVWFNV9NXZCN9XQ6XYEFHVGCXXCMYXYMNSERXFQ5FNS"

let { prefix: hrá¹•, words: dataPart } = bech32.decode(bech32lnurl, 2000)
let requestByteArray = bech32.fromWords(dataPart)

Buffer.from(requestByteArray).toString()
```
