WIP: LUD-24: LNURL chain.
=====================================================

`author: arcbtc`

Extends LUD-19, so ANY LNURL can be returned in the JSON response as an `action`. Upon success, if the `action` exists it will be automatically used. 

```diff
 {
   "tag": "withdrawRequest",
   "callback": string,
   "k1": string,
   "defaultDescription": string,
   "minWithdrawable": number,
   "maxWithdrawable": number,
   "balanceCheck": string,
+  "action": <string LNURL>
 }
```
