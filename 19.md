=====================================================

## Merging "pay" and "withdraw" related to a same `SERVICE` in a `WALLET`

LNURL-withdraw may contain a `payLink` in its JSON response. This is done to recognize a fact that `SERVICE` may want to allow both deposits and withdrawals to user account and as such make a static payment link easily discoverable from withdraw link.

When `WALLET` sees this it may store and show a compound item to user which would allow to both deposit and withdraw (and also to show an up-to-date `SERVICE` balance if LNURL-withdraw contains a `balanceCheck` field).

Modification required in `SERVICE` callback JSON of LNURL-withdraw:

```diff
 {
   tag: "withdrawRequest",
   callback: String,
   k1: String,
   defaultDescription: String,
   minWithdrawable: Integer,
   maxWithdrawable: Integer,
   balanceCheck: String,
+  payLink: String,
 }
```

`payLink` is raw URL (not bech32-encoded).
