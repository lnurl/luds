LUD-18: Payer identity in `payRequest` protocol.
================================================

---

The idea here is that the payer can identify itself when paying. The scope varies from free-form names (or [LUD-16](16.md) internet identifiers) useful for loose identification in comments or similar things, to cryptographic keys for proof of payment, to authentication keys for future login into a `SERVICE`'s website after a payment and other use cases.

## 1. `payerData` record

If `SERVICE` wants to get one or more types of payer identities from `WALLET` then it MUST alter its JSON response to the first callback to include a `payerData` field, as follows (notice that the `payerData` record below has a bunch of fields only for completion, an actual response will likely contain just a subset of these):

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "payerData": {
+    "name": { "mandatory": boolean },
+    "pubkey": { "mandatory": boolean },
+    "identifier": { "mandatory": boolean },
+    "email": { "mandatory": boolean },
+    "auth": {
+       "mandatory": boolean,
+       "k1": string // hex encoded 32 bytes of challenge
+    },
+    ...other fields may be negotiated
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

Notice that just including the payer id kind ("name", "pubkey" etc.) in the `payerData` record is enough to signal acceptance of that kind.

## 2. Specifying payer identity before sending a payment

In response to seeing a `payerData` record in the initial response from `SERVICE`, `WALLET` attaches a `payerdata` query parameter to LNURL-PAY callback with value set to a JSON object:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&payerdata=<urlencode({json object})>
```

The JSON object MUST be of the following format (notice that these fields are shown only for completion, in practice it will likely contain just a subset of these):

```Typescript
{
  "name": string, // free form string
  "pubkey": string, // hex(<randomly generated secp256k1 pubkey>),
  "auth": {
    "key": string, // hex(<linkingKey>)
    "k1": string, // same as received from service on section 1
    "sig": string, // following LUD-04: hex(sign(hexToBytes(<k1>), <linkingPrivKey>))
  },
  "email": string,
  "identifier": string,
  ...other fields may be included if supported by wallet and requested by service
}
```

Each key in this JSON object should correspond to a requested payerdata from the `payerData` record received from `SERVICE`.

`WALLET` CAN send any of the payer id kinds if they are listed in the `payerData` record. But if any is marked as `"mandatory": true` then `WALLET` MUST send or otherwise do not proceed with the payment flow.

`WALLET` SHOULD NOT send payer identity types omitted in `payerData` record, none at all if record is not present.
