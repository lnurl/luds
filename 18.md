LUD-18: Payer identity in `payRequest` protocol.
================================================

## Specifying payer identity before sending a payment

Payer MAY attach a `payerid` query parameter to LNURL-PAY callback with value set to JSON array:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&payerid=[<identity record>, ...]
```

JSON array may contain one or more records of the following forms:

1. `[ "text/plain", <free-form string> ]`
2. `[ "application/pubkey", hex(<randomly generated secp256k1 pubkey>) ]`
3. `[ "application/lnurl-auth", hex(<linkingKey>), hex(sign(utf8ToBytes(<k1>), <linkingPrivKey>)) ]`
4. `[ "text/identifier", <internet identifier> ]`
5. `[ "text/email", <email address> ]`
6. `[ "text/pay-back-option", <lightning invoice | lnurl-pay | email-like lightning address | ...> ]`

If present, JSON array MAY NOT contain more than one record with the same metadata type.

## Payer identity metadata record

If `LN SERVICE` wants to get one or more types of payer identities from `LN WALLET` then it MUST put the following record into metadata which contains `application/payer-ids` string as first item further followed by records each indicating a type of identitiy that `LN WALLET` is allowed to provide. 

```
[
  ...,
  [
    "application/payer-ids", 
    [ "text/plain" ],
    [ "application/pubkey" ],
    [ 
      "application/lnurl-auth", 
      isMandatory, // boolean which flags if user MAY include `application/lnurl-auth` record in callback or MUST do that
      k1 // hex encoded 32 bytes of challenge
    ],
    [ "text/identifier" ],
    [ "text/email" ],
    [ 
      "application/pay-back-option",
      isMandatory,
      [ "text/pay-back-invoice",
        minDuration // minimum time period for which the received invoice must be valid
      ],
      [ "text/pay-back-lnurlp" ],
      [ "text/pay-back-lightning-address" ],
      ...,
    ]
    ...,
  ],
]
```

`LN WALLET` SHOULD NOT send payer identity types omitted in `application/payer-ids` metadata record, none at all if record is not present.

Upon seeing an `application/lnurl-auth` record with `isMandatory` set to `false` user SHOULD be explicitly given an option to include an `LNURL-AUTH` record in callback.

Upon seeing an `application/lnurl-auth` record with `isMandatory` set to `true` user MUST be informed by `LN WALLET` that callback will contain an `LNURL-AUTH` record should a payment be sent.

When including an `LNURL-AUTH` record in a callback a `linkingKey` MUST be the one originally seen in `LNURL-PAY` static link.
