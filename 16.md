## Paying to [internet identifiers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1) (email-like addresses)

The idea here is that a `SERVICE` can offer human-readable addresses for users or specific internal endpoints that use the format `<username>@<domainname>`, e.g. satoshi@bitcoin.org. A user can then type these on a `WALLET`. The `<username>` is limited to `a-z0-9-_.`. Please note that this is way more strict than common email addresses as it allows fewer symbols and only lowercase characters.

Upon seeing such an address, `WALLET` makes a GET request to `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<username>` endpoint if `domain` is clearnet or `http://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<username>` if `domain` is onion. For example, if the address is `satoshi@bitcoin.org`, the request is to be made to `https://bitcoin.org/.well-known/lnurlp/satoshi`.

The response from `SERVICE` then MUST be the same as in [LUD-06](06.md), step 3, and the flow is the same.

If providing such a scheme, `SERVICE` MUST add to the `metadata` JSON array either a `text/email` entry or a `text/identifier` entry, as in examples below:

```
[
    "text/identifier", // optional indication that this payment link is associated with an internet identifier string
    content // an internet identifier string in standard user@site.com format
]
```

or

```
[
    "text/email", // optional indication that this payment link is associated with an email address
    content // an email string in standard user@site.com format
]
```

The `text/email` entry MUST be used if the internet identifier corresponds to an actual email address.
