=================================

## Support for LNURL-pay expiry

This allows for a `CLIENT` to pass a custom expiry property to a `SERVICE` that accepts it. This will enable clients to request time-sensitive invoices that can be used for example by escrow systems.

This is completely additional/ad-hoc, so current implementations are not affected by this. Any services and clients that wish to support it do need to add some more business logic.

### Service-side

`SERVICE` must alter its JSON response to the first callback to include a `minExpiry`/`maxExpiry` fields, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": string,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
   "commentAllowed": number,
+  "minExpiry": number,
+  "maxExpiry": number,
   "tag": "payRequest"
 }
```

The value of `minExpiry`/`maxExpiry` must be the inclusive range of seconds accepted for the `expiry` query parameter on subsequent callback.

### Client-side

`CLIENT` can include the expiry in its second callback to `SERVICE`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&expiry=<seconds>
```
