## Linking lightning address to a service

Paying apps require users to provide a lighning address to the service. Manual enter is difficult and error-prone. Instead the service can ask them to link the lighning address via `LNURL`.

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. User scans a LNURL QR code or accesses an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
2. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL.
3. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:
    ```Typescript
    {
        "tag": "linkLightningAddress", // type of LNURL
        "callback": string, // The URL which LN SERVICE would accept a lighning address as query parameter
        "k1": string, // Random or non-random string to identify the user's LN WALLET when using the callback URL,
        "serviceName": string // Name of the service to be displayed to the user
    }
    ```
    or

    ```JSON
    {"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}
    ```
4. `LN WALLET` displays a dialog: Would you like to share your lightning address (john@doe.com) with <serviceName>?
5. Once accepted by the user, `LN WALLET` sends a GET to `LN SERVICE` in the form of
    ```
    <callback>
      <?|&> // either '?' or '&' depending on whether there is a query string already in the callback
       k1=<k1> // the k1 specified in the response above
      &la=<lighning address> // user's lighning address
    ```
6. `LN SERVICE` sends a `{"status": "OK"}` or `{"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}` JSON response and then `LN WALLET` informs the user about the success or failure of the operation

Note that service will set a lighning address to anyone who can provide a valid ephemeral `k1`. In order to harden this a service may require authorization (LNURL-auth, email link etc.) before displaying a withdraw QR.
