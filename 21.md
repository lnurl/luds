LUD-12: Webhook notification support in `payRequest`.
=================================

## Support for LNURL-Pay webhook notification

This allows for a `WALLET` to pass a custom `webhook` property to a `SERVICE` that accepts it. This can have multiple use-cases. The idea is to allow a `WALLET` to request for the `SERVICE` to send updates on whether a given invoice has been `settled` or `expired` to a 3rd party `SERVICE` or `PROVIDER`.

This is completely additional/ad-hoc, so current implementations are not affected by this. Any services and wallets that wish to support it do need to add some more business logic.

### Service-side

`SERVICE` must alter its JSON response to the first callback to include a `webhookAllowed` field, as follows:

```diff
 {
   callback: String,
   maxSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   minSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   metadata: String,
+  webhookAllowed: Boolean,
   tag: "payRequest",
 }
```

The value of `webhookAllowed` should be of boolean type -- `true` or `false`. `WALLET` should interpret the property as `false` if is not provided on the response payload.

### Wallet-side

Upon seeing a `webhookAllowed` property set to `true` on the response from the `SERVICE`, a `WALLET` may then pass along a new query parameter named `webhook` to the second callback to `SERVICE`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&webhook=<String>
```

### Note on Webhook URL parameters

Webhook URLs must be SSL-enabled `https` URLs, and the `SERVICE` is encouraged to enable any and all restrictions and safety checks on their side. Additionally, [GET URL's accept around ~2000 characters for the entire request string](https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184). Therefore `webhook` query parameter can only be as large as to fit in the URL alongside any/all of the other properties outlined above.

### Service-side

When the invoice is `settled` or it `expired`, `SERVICE` must make a `POST` call to the `webhook` URL provided by the `WALLET` containing a body payload in the following format:

```diff
 {
+  invoice: String,
+  status: Status,
+  amount: MilliSatoshi,
 }
```

The `status` property should be of type String and be either `settled` or `expired`.

### LUD12 - Commenting Support

In the scenario where the `SERVICE` also supports [LUD12](./12.md) for commenting support, the `SERVICE` must also pass the `comment` property on the webhook payload.

```diff
 {
   invoice: String,
   status: Status,
   amount: MilliSatoshi,
+  comment: String,
 }
```

## LUD18 - Payer Data Identifiers

In the scenario where the `SERVICE` also supports [LUD18](./18.md) for handling payment data identifiers, the `SERVICE` must also pass the `payerData` property on the webhook payload.

Note that in reality there won't be as many `payerData` properties passed, these are simply the available options. Most likely only a subset of the properties inside `payerData` will be sent across in the webhook payload.

```diff
 {
   invoice: String,
   status: Status,
   amount: MilliSatoshi,
+  payerData: {
+    name: <free form string>,
+    pubkey: hex(<randomly generated secp256k1 pubkey>),
+    auth: {
+      key: hex(<linkingKey>),
+      k1: String, // same as received from service on section 1
+      sig: hex(sign(utf8ToBytes(<k1>), <linkingPrivKey>)) // following LUD-04
+    },
+    email: <email address>,
+    identifier: <internet identifier>,
+  }
 }
```
