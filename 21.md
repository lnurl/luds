LUD-21: pinLimit for withdrawRequest
====================================

## Optional Second Factor for `withdrawRequest` Authorization

Adding the optional `pinLimit` property to an LNURL-withdraw response allows a `SERVICE` to require a PIN to authorize a withdrawal above a given amount.

```diff
{
    "tag": "withdrawRequest",
    "callback": string,
    "defaultDescription": string, 
    "minWithdrawable": number,
+   "pinLimit": number,
    "maxWithdrawable": number
}
```

The `pinLimit` value must be a positive integer (including 0) with a maximum of 15 digits. If the `pinLimit` property is present and a `WALLET` (Point of Sale) intends to withdraw an amount equal to or greater than the `pinLimit` value (in millisatoshis) it must first acquire a 4-digit PIN from the user (customer) and then add it as `pin=<pin>` to the query string of the callback URL to authorize the withdrawal.

**Example callback:**

`https://ln-example.com?k1=<k1>&pr=<ln-invoice>&pin=<pin>`

If the `pinLimit` property is used, the `SERVICE` must check for and validate the `pin` query parameter of the callback request according to its policy before paying the invoice.

## Wallet Implementation Notes

If an LNURL-withdraw response includes a `pinLimit` property a `WALLET` should not automatically propose the invoice amount based on the `minWithdrawable`, `maxWithdrawable` or `pinLimit` values.

When acquiring a 4-digit PIN from the user (customer) via a PIN entry screen a `WALLET` should show the invoice amount on that same screen.

## Service Implementation Notes

Other than a fixed length of 4 digits this document makes no assumptions about whether PINs are static (multiple-use) or one-time passwords (OTPs) or other PIN security schemes.

A `SERVICE` may add the `pinLimit` property to its LNURL-withdraw response in accordance with its individual security policy.

A `SERVICE` should protect against brute force attacks by invalidating LNURLw links after the third PIN authorization failure.

## Security Considerations

PIN support improves security in cases of lost or maliciously scanned NFC payment devices.

Implementors should be aware that the PIN is leaked to the merchant point of sales device when entered by the customer.

Depending on the implementation of a `SERVICE`, security can be improved by using one-time PINs or by appropriate privacy configuration of NFC payment devices (e.g., enabling Random-ID support).
