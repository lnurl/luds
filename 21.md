LUD-21: Pay in local unit of account.
================================================

`author: ethanrose`

The idea here is to enable a merchant to receive an exact payment amount, in whatever currency their goods are priced in (i.e. their own fiat currency). A sender should be able to input the amount in the recipient's own unit of account.

Typically this is for a point-of-sale use-case where a lightning service is acting as a bitcoin-to-fiat payment processor. Currently, a sender would have to use their own calculator to determine how many sats to pay, and the recipient inevitably would receive the close-but-wrong amount. This bad experience is a hinderance to adoption of lightning as a cross-border payment system.

## 1. `currency` record in payRequest details

If `SERVICE` wishes for a `WALLET` user to specify a payment amount in a different unit of account, it MUST alter its JSON response in the payRequest details response to include a `currency` object, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "currency": {
+    "code": "PHP",
+    "name": "Philippine Pesos",
+    "symbol": "â‚±",
+    "minSendable": 1,
+    "maxSendable": 50000,
+    "multiplier": 64501 // estimated millisats per "unit"
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

NOTE: `SERVICE` must include a `multiplier` property. This is an estimate which helps the `WALLET` do frontend validation & set expectations for users. A simple helper for the `SERVICE` to calculate millisats `multiplier` from common BTC rates is:

```
10**11 / btcRate
```

## 2. User interface for specifying currency

If there is a `currency` record in the initial response, `WALLET` must display a modified interface:
- The wallet must display the `currency.code` and/or `currency.name` instead of its default currency.
- The wallet must enforce `currency.minSendable` and `currency.maxSendable`.

## 3. Including `currency` in callback parameters

In the next step of the LNURL-Pay flow, `WALLET` must include a `currency` query parameter in the callback along with the `amount`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<philippinePeso>&currency=PHP
```

## 4. User interface for reviewing & confirming the exchange rate

- `WALLET` must display a confirmation screen so that the user can review/verify and "approve" or "confirm" the resulting invoice amount.
