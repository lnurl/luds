===============================================

## Standardization of the `successAction` field

This defines a field `successAction` returned by the `SERVICE` along with the payment request in the second callback.

It must be stored by the `WALLET` and shown to the user as soon as a payment succeeds.

To implement this, a `SERVICE` must alter its JSON response to the second callback to include it like the following:

```diff
 {
 	pr: String,
 	routes: [],
+   successAction: Object,
 }
```

In which Object has the format:

```
{
   tag: String, // action type
   ...rest of fields depends on tag value
}
```

This document defines the _message_ and the _url_ types. See examples:

```
{
  tag: 'message',
  message: 'Thank you for using bike-over-ln co! Your rental bike is unlocked now' // Up to 144 characters
}
```

```
{
   tag: 'url'
   description: 'Thank you for your purchase. Here is your order details' // Up to 144 characters
   url: 'https://www.ln-service.com/order/<orderId>' // url domain must be the same as `callback` domain at step 3
}
```

### LNURL-pay flow change

A `WALLET` that decides to implement this scheme must, after a payment is complete and a `successAction` is present, show a popup or screen to the user with the contents of that `successAction`.

For _message_, a toaster or popup is sufficient. For _url_, the wallet should give the user a popup which displays `description`, `url`, and a 'open' button to open the `url` in a new browser tab.

`WALLET` should also store `successAction` data on the transaction record.

### Support for `successAction` types

Since other `successAction` types can be added in the future, if a `successAction` is present in the response from `SERVICE`, a `WALLET` must make sure that its `tag` value is of a kind it supports, otherwise it must not proceed with the payment -- or the user might end up paying and not seeing its expected `successAction`.
