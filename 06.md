The idea here is that a wallet can scan a static QR code or click on a static LNURL address and get back details about a payment that is expected. The details may include much more extensive metadata than a normal Lightning invoice. And the amounts may be fixed or within a range.

Then, once the user accepts the terms (and choose an amount, if that is not fixed), the wallet will call the service and get a Lightning invoice specific for that payment, containing a hash of the metadata as its [`h` tag (`description_hash`)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md#requirements-3) and proceed to pay the invoice if it matches the expected amount and hash.

## Pay to static QR/NFC/link

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. User scans a LNURL QR code or pastes/shares an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
2. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL.
3. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:

    ```
    {
        callback: String, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters
        maxSendable: MilliSatoshi, // Max amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive
        minSendable: MilliSatoshi, // Min amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive, can not be less than 1 or more than `maxSendable`
        metadata: String, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string here, this is required to pass signature verification at a later step
        tag: "payRequest" // Type of LNURL
    }
    ```
    or

    ```
    {"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}
    ```

    `metadata` json array must contain one `text/plain` entry, all other types of entries are optional.
    `metadata` json array must contain either one `image/png;base64` entry or one `image/jpeg;base64` entry or neither.

    The `metadata` json array is only allowed to contain arrays. The first item of an array inside the `metadata` array is always a string representing the metadata type while any item that follows can be of any JSON type. Implementors MUST NOT assume it will always be a string.

    ```
    [
        [
            "text/plain", // mandatory, short description displayed when paying and in transaction log
            content // actual metadata content
        ],
        [
            "text/long-desc", // optional longer description of the payment, MAY contain newlines
            content // actual metadata content
        ],
        [
            "image/png;base64", // optional 512x512px PNG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid
            content // base64 string, up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        [
            "image/jpeg;base64", // optional 512x512px JPG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid
            content // base64 string, up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        ... // more objects for future types
    ]
    ```

    and be sent as a string:

    ```
    "[[\"text/plain\", \"lorem ipsum blah blah\"]]"
    ```

3. `LN WALLET` displays a payment dialog where user can specify an exact sum to be sent which would be bounded by:

	```
	max can send = min(maxSendable, local estimation of how much can be sent from wallet)
	min can send = max(minSendable, local minimal value allowed by wallet)
	```
	Additionally, a payment dialog must include:
	- Domain name extracted from `LNURL` query string.
	- A way to view the metadata sent of `text/plain` format.

    And it may include:
    - An image element with the contents of `image/png` or `image/jpeg`.

4. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request using

	```
	<callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
	```

    `amount` being the amount specified by the user in millisatoshis.

5. `LN Service` takes the GET request and returns JSON response of form:

	```
	{
		pr: String, // bech32-serialized lightning invoice
		routes: [], // an empty array
	}
	```

	or

	```
	{"status":"ERROR", "reason":"error details..."}
	```

6. `LN WALLET` Verifies that `h` tag in provided invoice is a hash of `metadata` string converted to byte array in UTF-8 encoding.
7. `LN WALLET` Verifies that amount in provided invoice equals the amount previously specified by user.
10. `LN WALLET` pays the invoice, no additional user confirmation is required at this point.
11. Once payment is fulfilled `LN WALLET` executes a non-null `successAction`. For `message`, a toaster or popup is sufficient. For `url`, the wallet should give the user a popup which displays `description`, `url`, and a 'open' button to open the `url` in a new browser tab. For `aes`, `LN WALLET` must attempt to decrypt a `ciphertext` with payment preimage. `LN WALLET` should also store `successAction` data on the transaction record.

## Notes on metadata for server-side LNURL-PAY

### When client makes a first call:

Construct a metadata object, turn it into json, then include it into parent json as a string.

### When client makes a second call

1. Make a hash as follows: `sha256(utf8ByteArray(unescaped_metadata_string))`.
2. Generate a payment request using an obtained hash.
