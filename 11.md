LUD-11: Disposable and storeable `payRequest`s.
===============================================

## `disposable` field

This document defines a `disposable` field that may be returned by `SERVICE` along with a payment request in the second LNURL-pay callback.

```diff
 {
 	pr: String,
 	routes: [],
+   disposable: Boolean,
 }
```

This field may be used by a `WALLET` to decide whether the initial LNURL link will be stored locally for later reuse or erased. If `disposable` is `null`, it should be interpreted as `true`, so if `SERVICE` intends its LNURL links to be stored it must return `disposable: false`.
