=====================================================

## `text/long-desc` for pay protocol metadata

`SERVICE` in the pay protocol `MAY` include a `text/long-desc` entry in the metadata payload, with the intended purpose being a longer description of the payment. It MAY contain newlines and SHOULD provide a more detailed description of the payment.

`WALLET` MUST upon recognizing the `text/long-desc` metadata use it as the payment description in the pay screen.
`WALLET` MAY display the `text/long-desc` text together with the `text/plain` text.

If `text/long-desc` is not included in the metadata payload,`text/plain` MUST instead be used on the pay screen.
